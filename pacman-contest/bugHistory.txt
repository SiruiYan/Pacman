Attacker Strategies:
1. predict the position of enemies even out of visual range for strategy determination
2. find path to the closest food

bugHistory:
1. no path found when distance to enemy is less than 1 because all neighbour positions are within
    enemy's coverage (square that is left, right, up, down 1 distance away from our pacman)
2. go back and forth near the side border when enemy is near (go back home when entering enemy side
    and go enemy side while in home side)
3. need to relocate food when we are eaten


Strategies to add:
1. go back home when holding more than 5 food
2. may be too timid in attacking with no food carried
    solution: escape only when distance to enemy is less than 3 with no food carried
3. ignore scared enemy

bug solutions:
1. set enemy coverage to be the position that the enemy is in instead of the square
2.
